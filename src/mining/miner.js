/* The browser miner: a pool of workers, a template, and the one signature that
 * makes the reward yours.
 *
 * The winning digest has to be signed by the key the coinbase pays. So this
 * file, and not the node, holds the key: the node hands out a candidate that
 * pays whoever asked for it, and if you ask with someone else's public key you
 * have just mined them a block. Work handed to you cannot be redirected — which
 * is a different and weaker property than non-outsourceability, because the
 * private key never enters the hash loop. See docs/mining.md.
 *
 * The private key never leaves this page. It is not sent on submit — only the
 * signature over the digest is.
 *
 * ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * THE CURVE CHANGED, AND THE HASHING DID NOT (docs/evm-spec.md §4).
 *
 * Homefire is untouched: the pad fill, the walk, the digest and the target
 * comparison are exactly what they were, they still live in homefire.js and
 * worker.js, and test/browser-pow.test.ts checks them digest for digest against
 * the node. Nothing in this file's hash loop moved.
 *
 * What moved is the key the proof BINDS. The coinbase has to receive the block
 * reward and the fees, so it must be an account the account-model chain can
 * credit — which means a secp256k1 key and a 0x address, not an Ed25519 key and
 * an ember1 one. So `coinbasePub` is now the uncompressed secp256k1 public key
 * and the proof signature is ECDSA over the same digest bytes.
 *
 * There is exactly one secp256k1 implementation in this front-end — the wallet's
 * port of node/src/crypto/secp256k1.js, cross-checked against it over hundreds
 * of random keys in assets/wallet-selftest.js. Two independent browser ports of
 * one curve is how they drift apart, so this file imports that one rather than
 * carrying its own.
 *
 * THE WIRE FORMAT. `powSig` is r || s || recoveryId — 32 + 32 + 1 bytes, 130
 * lowercase hex characters — signed over the winning digest as-is.
 *
 * This file used to say 64 bytes with no recovery id, on the reasoning that the
 * header already carries `coinbasePub` so a verifier needs no recovery. It reads
 * as sound and it was wrong: the node requires 65 (`node/src/chain/miner.js`
 * `submit` tests /^[0-9a-f]{130}$/, and `node/src/chain/header.js` `verifyPow`
 * refuses anything that is not 65 bytes and recovers the key from it). The
 * comment predicted its own failure — "if phase 5 chooses a 65-byte recoverable
 * form instead, this is the one line to change" — and phase 5 did, and nobody
 * changed the line. Every block this miner ever found was answered `bad
 * signature` AFTER doing the work, with no way to tell that from bad luck.
 *
 * `POW_SIG_FORM` below exists so a mismatch is a grep rather than an
 * investigation, and it was faithfully kept in sync with the wrong answer. So
 * the format is now checked instead of described: `test/browser-pow.test.ts`,
 * in this repository, signs a real winning digest with `proofSignature`,
 * requires it byte for byte equal to what hearth's own
 * `node/src/chain/header.js` `signProof` produces, and drives the node's real
 * template flow until it accepts the block.
 *
 * WHERE THIS SENTENCE USED TO POINT. At hearth's `node/test/browser-proof.js`,
 * which did not exist when this file was restored here on 2026-08-06 — the
 * citation came with the code. hearth has it again now, importing this very
 * file from a checkout of this repository. That is a real gate and it is not
 * this one: it runs in hearth's CI, on hearth's schedule, most likely after a
 * change here has already been published by this repository's own workflow.
 * micro-org#298.

/**
 * The boot sequence. The order is not arbitrary.
 *
 *   1. Observability first, so an exception thrown by anything below is reported rather than lost.
 *      A crash during the first render is the single most valuable event this app can send.
 *   2. `bootstrapSession()` second, and AWAITED, so the SSO hand-off code in the URL fragment is
 *      redeemed before React mounts. It strips `#cf_code` from the address bar before the exchange
 *      goes over the wire — see the note at `ui/packages/ui/src/index.tsx:202-208`. Rendering first
 *      would show a signed-out shell to somebody who has just signed in, and would leave the code
 *      on screen for the length of a network round trip.
 *   3. Render last.
 *
 * Step 2 runs on this surface too, even though **no page here needs a session at all**: the chain
 * read is anonymous (`indexer/src/server.ts:792-801`) and the three faucet routes are
 * unauthenticated (`faucet/src/server.ts:334-335`), and this bundle sends no bearer to any of them.
 * It runs because the code has to leave the address bar whether or not the page that follows uses
 * it — a hand-off code sitting in a shared link is a hand-off code somebody else can redeem. The
 * session it may establish reaches the shared company bar and nothing else.

/**
 * HOW THE BROWSER MINER LEARNS THE TIP MOVED — AND WHAT IT DOES WHEN IT CANNOT.
 *
 * ══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS.
 *
 * micro-org#236: `/mine` opened `new EventSource(`${rpc}/events`)` and set only `onmessage`. The
 * estate's gateway published `/mining/template` and `/mining/submit` and NOT `/events`, so the
 * stream was answered 405 by the JSON-RPC router. A non-200 is fatal to an `EventSource` —
 * `readyState` goes to CLOSED and the browser does not retry — and with no `onerror` nothing
 * noticed. The page ran on its 45-second fallback timer for months while its own code said it was
 * following the chain, and the only symptom was a stale rate nobody could attribute.
 *
 * THAT IS THE FAILURE THIS FILE IS ABOUT, AND IT IS NOT THE 405. The gateway is fixed in
 * micro-deploy; a client that cannot tell a live stream from a dead one will produce this same
 * silence the next time anything upstream refuses — a saturated node (`SSE_MAX_CLIENTS`, 503), the
 * gateway's per-IP stream cap (`cf-sse-inflight`, 429), a corporate proxy that buffers, a phone
 * moving between networks. So what is asserted here is the CLIENT'S OWN HONESTY: it must know
 * which of the two it is in, poll harder when it is blind, and say so on screen.
 *
 * ── NO DOM, FOR THE REASON test/browser-stubs.ts GIVES ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * jsdom is a second browser implementation to keep current and it disagrees with real ones exactly
 * where it matters. `_follow()` touches three globals — `EventSource`, `setInterval` and
 * `document` — and all three are stubbed below. The stub `EventSource` never connects to anything:
 * it exposes `readyState` and lets the test fire `onopen`/`onerror` by hand, which is precisely the
 * pair of transitions the shipped code had no answer for.
 *
 * ── WHAT IS NOT ASSERTED HERE, AND WHERE IT LIVES ─────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * That the node serves the stream, caps it and heartbeats it: `hearth/node/test/sse.js`. That the
 * gateway routes it: micro-deploy's `cf-api-mining-events` router. Three repositories, three
 * halves; this one owns only "what does the browser do about it".
